## Hints
- Use a list to store items: `shopping_list = []`
- Each item is a dictionary: `{"name": "Apples", "quantity": 6, "price": 0.50, "purchased": False}`
- Use a while loop for the main menu
- Use functions for each operation (add_item, remove_item, etc.)
- Use f-strings for formatted output
- Use enumerate() when displaying numbered lists

## Challenge
Add these advanced features:
1. Save shopping list to a file
2. Load shopping list from a file
3. Sort items by name, price, or quantity
4. Export to CSV format
5. Add categories to items
