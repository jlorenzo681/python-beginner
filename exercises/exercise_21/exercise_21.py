# Exercise 21: Number Guessing Game with Statistics
# Objective: Create a guessing game that tracks player statistics

# Hint: Import random module for random number generation
# Hint: Use a list to store all guesses
# Hint: Use try-except for input validation
# Hint: Provide hints after every 3 wrong guesses
# Hint: Calculate statistics from the guesses list

import random

# Game setup
# Generate random number between 1 and 100


# Initialize variables
# attempts counter
# empty list for guesses
# variables for tracking high/low bounds


print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n")

# Main game loop
# Continue until correct guess


    # Get user input with validation


    # Check if guess is correct, too high, or too low


    # Provide hint after every 3 wrong guesses


# Display congratulations message


# Display statistics
# All guesses, number of attempts, highest and lowest guess
